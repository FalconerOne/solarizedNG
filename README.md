# SolarizedNG-GiveAway (Full App)

This is the full developer-ready SolarizedNG GiveAway app. It includes a Next.js frontend, API routes for Paystack and messaging, and SQL schema + seed data for Supabase.

## Quick start
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill with your keys.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run locally: `npm run dev` (requires Supabase project to be created and SQL applied).
4. Deploy: push repo to GitHub and connect to Vercel (or upload ZIP as instructed previously).
